  <h1>What is Climate Change</h1>  
<p>
    Climate, refers to the long-term regional or global average of temperature, humidity and rainfall patterns over seasons, years or decades.
While the weather can change in just a few hours, climate changes over longer timeframes. Climate change is the significant variation of average weather conditions becoming, for example, warmer, wetter, or drierâ€”over several decades or longer. It is the longer-term trend that differentiates climate change from natural weather variability.
